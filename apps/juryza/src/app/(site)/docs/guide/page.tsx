        <Steps>
          <Step index={1} title="Create an account and register">
            Sign up, then open the event and register. Creating or joining a team registers you
            automatically.
          </Step>
          <Step index={2} title="Form or join a team">
            Start a team and share its invite link, or join one with a link. One team per person per
            event; teams lock at the submission deadline so rosters cannot be reshuffled once
            judging starts.
          </Step>
          <Step index={3} title="Build your project page">
            Add a title, tagline, write-up, repo, live URL, demo video and tech tags. The write-up
            is rich text stored safely as structured content.
          </Step>
          <Step index={4} title="Submit before the deadline">
            Submitting is enforced by the server against the clock — a late submission is refused no
            matter what the browser says. You can keep editing until the deadline.
          </Step>
          <Step index={5} title="Follow results">
            After the organizer publishes, your placement, any awards and your certificate appear on
            the event and on your public profile.

      <DocSection title="For judges" icon={Gavel}>
        <Prose>
          Judges only ever see the projects assigned to them — cross-judge reads are refused by the
          backend, not just hidden in the UI.
        </Prose>
        <Steps>
          <Step index={1} title="Accept the panel invitation">
            The organizer invites you by email; the link is bound to that address, so a forwarded
            link will not work for another account.
          </Step>
          <Step index={2} title="Open your queue">
            Your assignments appear in Judging. If you are limited to certain tracks, you only
            receive projects from those tracks, and never a project from a team you belong to.
          </Step>
          <Step index={3} title="Score against the rubric">
            Give an integer 1–5 for every criterion. Partial scores are refused; the weighted
            aggregate and the cross-judge normalization are computed on read, so re-weighting never
            leaves stale numbers behind.
          </Step>
          <Step index={4} title="Or judge pairwise">
            Some events use pairwise judging: pick the better of two projects and a Bradley–Terry
            model ranks them. This needs no calibration and is a good cross-check on rubric scores.

            Set the name, dates, tracks, prizes and the weighted rubric. Draft events are visible

            Invite judges by email and optionally limit each to tracks. Then generate assignments —
            balanced (every project gets the same number of reviews) or batch (contiguous chunks per
            judge), with a dry-run preview.

          </Step>
          <Step index={5} title="Publish results">
            Publishing is refused while voting is open, so a live vote can never see standings. On
