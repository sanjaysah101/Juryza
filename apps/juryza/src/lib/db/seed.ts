/**
 * Seed the portal. Runs at container boot after the schema is pushed.
 *
 * Idempotent: if any user exists the seed does nothing (so restarting never
 * wipes real data); `SEED_RESET=1` truncates everything first.
 *
 *  1. Well-known accounts: admin, organizer, judge_a, judge_b, participant.
 *  2. The DOGFOOD fixture event, imported through the same importer the
 *     `POST /api/events/import` endpoint uses — with the fixture's *past*
 *     submission deadline, so the portal is honestly closed to submissions.
 *     Community voting is open, so the T3 flow is live on first boot.
 *  3. A sandbox event with submissions open, so an evaluator can walk the whole
 *     lifecycle (team → project → judging → results) without editing dates.
 *  4. API tokens for the four checker roles, written to `.dogfood.toml`.
