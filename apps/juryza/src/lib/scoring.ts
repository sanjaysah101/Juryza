/**
 * Scoring and cross-judge normalization.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and deterministic so it can be unit-tested and so the
 * numbers a judge sees, the CSV export, and the results page all agree. Nothing
 * is stored pre-aggregated: re-weighting the rubric or a late score edit is
 * always reflected because the aggregate is computed on read.
 *
 * The maths is documented in full in JUDGING.md. In brief:
 *
 * - A **raw score** for one (judge, project) is the weighted mean of that
 *   judge's per-criterion marks, weights normalized to sum to 1.
 * - **Normalization** corrects for judges who run hot or cold. For each judge we
 *   compute the mean and standard deviation of their raw scores, convert each of
 *   their scores to a z-score, then map the z-scores back onto the 1–5 scale
 *   using the global mean and a fixed spread. A judge who marks everything a 3
 *   (zero variance) contributes no signal, so their scores collapse to the
 *   global mean rather than blowing up a divide-by-zero.
 * - A **project's final score** is the mean of its normalized scores.
