 * `app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`).
 *
 * **This file is the provider seam, and it is the only one.** It exports exactly
 * the same three things the custom-backend variant does — `auth`,
 * `signInInputSchema`, `signUpInputSchema` — so every page and component
 * (`login`, `signup`, `forgot-password`, `dashboard`, `nav-bar`) imports from
 * `@/lib/auth` and works unchanged against either provider. That is the whole
 * point of `@juryza/auth-core`: swapping providers is swapping this file.
 *
 * Notice how much smaller it is than the custom-backend version. That file must
 * declare every endpoint path and response schema, because it talks to a backend
 * it knows nothing about. Better Auth owns both ends of the wire, so there is
 * nothing to describe — only the client to construct and the user shape to narrow.
