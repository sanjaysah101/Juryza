/**
 * Configuration for the Better Auth provider.
 *
 * Deliberately thin. Unlike `@juryza/auth-custom` — which must be told every
 * endpoint path and response schema, because it talks to a backend it knows
 * nothing about — Better Auth owns both ends of the wire. It already knows its
 * own routes and shapes, so re-describing them here would be duplication that
 * can only drift.
 *
 * What this provider adds is the *contract adapter*: a translation from Better
 * Auth's client into `AuthContract`, so the shared auth UI works unchanged. See
 * [docs/auth-providers-design.md](../../../docs/auth-providers-design.md).
