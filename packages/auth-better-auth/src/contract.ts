/**
 * Adapt Better Auth's client to `AuthContract`, so the shared auth UI
 * (`@juryza/auth-ui`) renders against Better Auth exactly as it does against a
 * custom backend. That is the whole point: one set of components, any provider.
 *
 * Verified by spike before this was written — Better Auth's client satisfies the
 * contract with no changes to `auth-core`. See
 * [docs/auth-providers-design.md](../../../docs/auth-providers-design.md).
 *
 * **Tier 1 only** (sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, session, password reset). Better
 * Auth's Tier 2 flows — 2FA, passkeys, magic links, organizations — are reached
 * through its own client and plugins, or through
 * [better-auth-ui](https://better-auth-ui.com); they are deliberately not
 * squeezed through this contract, which a hand-rolled backend also has to be able
 * to implement.
 *
 * **Client-side only.** For server components and route handlers, use
 * `@juryza/auth-better-auth/server` — Better Auth's real strength, and outside
 * the contract by design.

/**
 * Turn Better Auth's error into an `AuthResult`.
 *
 * Better Auth returns errors rather than throwing, and every one of them is a
 * runtime condition the UI must render — a wrong password, an email already in
 * use, a rate limit. So they all become `{ ok: false }`.
 *
 * Note this differs from `@juryza/auth-custom`, which distinguishes a `ZodError`
 * (the backend's response didn't match its declared schema — a bug, thrown) from
 * an `HttpError` (a runtime failure — returned). That split exists there because
 * the response shape is *asserted* by the caller and can be wrong. Here Better
 * Auth owns both ends, so there is no schema to mismatch and nothing to throw.
